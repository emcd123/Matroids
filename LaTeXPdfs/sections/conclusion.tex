Greedoids are an interesting area of research which I would love the opportunity to fully investigate. However this is just the most basic characterisation of greedoids and some appropriate axioms which at least allow us to find a subset of the possible greedoids and set-systems that yield optimal solutions by way of the greedy algorithm.
