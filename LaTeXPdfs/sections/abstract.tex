\noindent Matroids are an abstraction of the concept of linear dependence which has since developed into the rich field known as matroid theory\cite{whitney}. They are extremely flexible systems of sets that can be characterised in a number of diverse ways; in this paper we focus on matroids formed from graphs. In particular, we focus on the optimality of the greedy algorithm in solving optimisation problems in graph theory such as the minimal spanning tree problem which can be solved in this way when the independent sets of the graph form a matroid. Futhermore, we show that matroids are the only hereditary systems for which this is true. The paper concludes with some insight into other set-systems which provide optimal solutions for combinatorial optimisation problems through the greedy algorithm.
