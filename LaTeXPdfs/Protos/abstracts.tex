This paper focuses on the optimality of the greedy algorithm in solving optimisation problems, in particular for the maximal/minimal spanning tree problem using independence systems and in particular matroids. Matroids are algebraic structurs that abstract the notion of linear depence according to H.Whitney in his seminal paper on matroid theory. Here we investigate the connection between graphs and matroids with the aim of solving the minimal spanning tree problem. Finally, we look at the concept of a greedoid, a similar idea to matroids, where we attempt to characterise some of the set-systems that gaurantee optimal solutions via the greedy algorithm.
