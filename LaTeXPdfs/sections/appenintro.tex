This final section describes my work concerning implementing the optimisation procedures described throughout this paper. I provide any of the auxillary algorithms mentioned or necessary to implement for example Kruskal's algorithm or to adapt your own form of the generic greedy algorithm.  Any code used during this project can be found at my github repository for this project \cite{github}, including an almost complete implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm.
