This appendix is mainly concerned with the practicalities of implementing the optimisation procedures described throughout this paper. It provides any of the auxillary algorithms mentioned or necessary to implement for example Kruskal's algorithm or to adapt your own form of the generic greedy algorithm. These processes are described here in order not to distract from the main information in the paper.  Any code used during this project can be found at my github repository for this project \cite{github}, including an almost complete implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm.
