This final section describes my work concerning implementing the optimisation procedures described throughout this paper. I provide any of the auxiliary algorithms mentioned or necessary to implement for example Kruskal's algorithm or to adapt your own form of the generic greedy algorithm, although I omit the full implementation.  Any code used during this project can be found at my github repository for this project\cite{github}.
