# Matroids

### Details:

**Written by:** emcd123

**For:** Undergraduate Thesis for Mathematical Science at NUIG(*National University of Ireland Galway*)

## Project Description: 

A matroid is a structure that abstracts and generalizes the notion of
linear independence in vector spaces. There are many equivalent ways to define
a matroid, the most significant being in terms of independent sets, bases, circuits,etc.

Our primary target is to explain the connection between matroids and the greedy algorithm.
The Greedy algorithm is an interesting characterization of matroids in that it
arises frequently in problems related to combinatorial optimzation. For example
the well known graph optimization problem: finding the minimum spanning
tree. Leading to a connection between Kruskalâ€™s algorithm and matroids.
